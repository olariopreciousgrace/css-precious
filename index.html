        <h3>Childhood</h3>
        <p>I grew up surrounded by a loving family, spending most of my days playing with dolls and sharing simple joys with just a few close friends.</p>
        <h3>Teenage Life</h3>
        <p>My teenage years were filed with experiences that were both fun and challenging, and each encounter taught me something new. Looking back those moments helped me realize the importance of growth and gave me the wake up call to start thinking seriously about my future.</p>
        <h3>Adulthood</h3>
        <p>Now in adulthood, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Saint Michael College of Caraga, and I look forward to encountering more meaningful experiences that will shape my future.</p>
